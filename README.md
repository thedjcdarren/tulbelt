# Tulbelt

Quality-of-life toggles for [tulip.co](https://tulip.co). Tulbelt is a small,
dependency-free Manifest V3 browser extension: a popup with on/off switches,
each one a self-contained tweak to the Tulip web UI.

> **Unofficial.** Tulbelt is a community project and is not affiliated with,
> endorsed by, or supported by Tulip Interfaces. "Tulip" is used only to
> describe what the extension works with.

> **No guarantees.** Every toggle works by tweaking Tulip's web UI, which Tulip
> can change at any time without notice. There is no guarantee a toggle will
> keep working in future Tulip releases, or that it works on every Tulip
> version or instance — a toggle may stop having any effect, or behave
> unexpectedly, after a Tulip update. Use at your own risk; if a toggle
> misbehaves, switch it off (every toggle reverts cleanly when disabled).

## What it does

Open the toolbar popup to see every available toggle; hover the **i** beside a
switch for its description, and use **Select all** / **Unselect all** above the
list to flip everything at once. A few examples of what's in there:

- **Sort tables by newest** — opens table views sorted by `_createdAt` desc.
- **Dark mode** — a filter-inversion dark theme for tulip.co.
- **Copy/Cut in widget menu** — adds Copy/Cut to the app editor canvas menu.
- **Visual filters editor** — a row-per-filter builder for connector `filters`.
- **Fuzzy expression autocomplete** — substring matching in the formula editor.

The full, authoritative list lives in [`features.js`](./features.js) and is
rendered automatically in the popup — no list here to drift out of date. For a
per-toggle reference with defaults and notes, see
[docs/toggles.md](./docs/toggles.md).

## Install (from source)

There is no build step. Load the repository directly:

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` (Chrome) or `edge://extensions` (Edge).
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the repository folder.
5. Pin the **Tulbelt** icon and open the popup on any `*.tulip.co` page.

Toggles take effect immediately — no page reload needed for most of them, and
every toggle is designed to cleanly revert when switched back off.

## How it works

- `manifest.json` — MV3 manifest; declares content scripts and permissions.
- `features.js` — the feature **registry**. One entry per toggle. The popup
  and the background worker both read from this.
- `popup.html` / `popup.js` — auto-renders a switch for every registered
  feature; no per-feature popup code.
- `background.js` — service worker. Syncs `declarativeNetRequest` rules for
  features that declare a network `rule` (e.g. URL redirects).
- `toggles/<feature>.js` — one content script per DOM/behavior tweak. Each reads
  its on/off state from `chrome.storage.local` and applies or reverts itself.
- `docs/` — design notes for the more involved features.

## Reporting issues

Bug reports and toggle ideas go through
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dapomeranz/tulbelt/issues/new/choose) — pick
**Bug report** or **Feature request**.

Because every toggle works by tweaking Tulip's web UI, a tweak that works on one
Tulip version can break on another (see the "No guarantees" note above). The
bug report form **requires the Tulip version** your instance is running, along
with your browser and Tulbelt version — without the Tulip version a report
usually can't be acted on, since most breakage is version-specific. Before
filing, it's worth toggling the feature off to confirm the page fully restores;
the form asks for that too.

change. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the architecture and the
